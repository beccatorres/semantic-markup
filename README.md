# semantic-markup

**Refactoring**

In this assigment, I have edited to code to follow accessibility standards in order to make it an easier website to navigate for a broader spectrum of visitors.

I have also made it so that when reading the code, you are able to indentify invidual elements and have added spacing to make it more legible for others looking to also edit or read the html.
