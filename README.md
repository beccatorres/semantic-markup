# semantic-markup

**Refactoring**

In this assigment, I have edited the html to follow accessibility standards in order for a broader spectrum of users to access the content with ease.

I have also made it so that when you read the html you are able to indentify invidual elements and have added spacing to make it more legible for others looking at the html script.
